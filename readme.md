//Splash Page
• Splash page should be log-in or register

//Artist - Views
• Need a leaderboard section
• Artist by ID page should show comments, ratings, and additional information.
• Add comment field to artist review form

//Ratings - Views
• When user rates a band, the band should disappear from "inbox"
  and then show up under "my reviews".
  
//Middleware
• Add auth to routes as middleware

//Refactoring
• make a helper doc for functions to be reused.
• can any loops be mapped for better performance? Look at ratings scoring.
